      <h1>Predicting Daily Road Collisions with Weather, Calendars & Machine Learning</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        An end-to-end analytics and modelling project that explores what truly drives daily road collision risk,
        comparing interpretable linear models with a TensorFlow deep neural network to forecast collision frequency
        using calendar and weather signals.
      </p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Urban safety teams, emergency services and transport planners need reliable and explainable indicators
        to allocate resources, schedule enforcement and communicate risk.
        This project was designed to answer three practical questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which factors correlate most strongly with daily road collision frequency?</li>
        <li>Can a simple, transparent model forecast risk accurately enough for planning?</li>
        <li>Do non-linear machine learning models add meaningful value over linear baselines?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time span:</strong> mid-2012 to 2019 (2012 partial year; COVID-era excluded)</li>
        <li><strong>Target variable:</strong> total daily collision count (normalised for modelling)</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar features:</strong> year, month, day-of-week, day-of-year, global day index</li>
        <li><strong>Weather features:</strong> temperature (avg/min/max), dew point, precipitation, visibility,
            wind speed, max wind speed, fog indicator, sea-level pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data were joined at daily resolution and explored across years to assess stability, distributions
        and potential regime changes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Feature Engineering & Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One-hot encoding for months (12) and weekdays (7)</li>
        <li>Creation of day-of-year and global day index to stack yearly patterns</li>
        <li>Normalisation of collision counts for cross-year comparability</li>
        <li>80/20 train-test split with 20% of training held out for validation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Exploratory Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly behaviour dominates:</strong> day of week shows the strongest correlation with collisions (r ≈ 0.53)</li>
        <li><strong>Weather effects are modest:</strong> temperature (r ≈ 0.23) and dew point (r ≈ 0.21) are weakly positive</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal impact:</strong> precipitation, fog, wind and visibility correlations are near zero</li>
        <li><strong>Year-to-year stability:</strong> collision distributions remain tightly banded across years,
            indicating routine and behaviour over traditional seasonality</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Modelling Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear baselines (TensorFlow/Keras):</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Day-only model -> MAE (Mean Absolute Error) ≈ 0.144 (normalised)</li>
            <li>Day + temperature + dew point -> MAE ≈ 0.127</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deep Neural Network:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Architecture: Normalisation → Dense(48, ReLU) → Dense(48, ReLU) → Dense(1)</li>
            <li>Inputs: year, temperature, dew point, one-hot months, one-hot weekdays</li>
            <li>Training: Adam optimiser, MAE loss, 100 epochs</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DNN performance:</strong> MAE ≈ 0.123 on the held-out test set</li>
        <li><strong>Value of non-linearity:</strong> modest improvement over linear baselines by learning interactions
            (e.g., warm mid-week days vs weekends)</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretability preserved:</strong> predictions align with exploratory findings —
            weekday traffic intensity dominates; weather fine-tunes risk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example predictions showed Sunday in summer consistently lower risk than mid-week days at similar temperatures,
        reinforcing the primacy of behavioural patterns.

      <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Weekday-weighted staffing and enforcement planning for police and EMS</li>
        <li>Calendar-aware public risk messaging during peak commute days</li>
        <li>Policy evaluation by comparing interventions against predicted baselines</li>
        <li>Foundations for insurance, fleet and city-safety risk scoring</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Ethics & Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Predictions are intended to support resource allocation, not to stigmatise communities</li>
        <li>Uncertainty must be communicated clearly; human oversight remains essential</li>
        <li>Dataset lacks exposure variables (traffic volume, holidays, events),
            suggesting future gains from richer data and time-aware validation</li>
      </ul>
