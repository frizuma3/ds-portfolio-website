      <h1>A Data-Driven Exploration of Mental Health Trends in Scotland Pre- & Post-COVID-19 (R & Shiny)</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        As part of my MSc in Applied Data Analytics at the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI),
        I used public health data, advanced time-series modelling and visual analytics to understand how COVID-19 reshaped
        mental health service patterns across Scotland and to translate complex results into an interactive Shiny dashboard
        for evidence-based decision-making.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Public discussion during the pandemic highlighted loneliness, anxiety and burnout but evidence was often fragmented.
        This project set out to answer three questions using data rather than assumption:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Did mental health service use rise or fall after COVID-19 began?</li>
        <li>Which age groups and regions were most affected?</li>
        <li>How did policy changes and NHS pressures influence access to care?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal was to transform Scotland’s public health data into actionable insight that can inform future policy,
        planning and equitable recovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Public Health Scotland and NHS Scotland datasets</li>
        <li><strong>Time period:</strong> 2018–2023 (pre- and post-March 2020 disruption)</li>
        <li><strong>Key measures:</strong> psychiatric inpatient admissions and referrals</li>
        <li><strong>Context indicators:</strong> mental health expenditure by local authority</li>
        <li><strong>Breakdowns:</strong> health board, age, gender and geographic variation</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> ICD-10 categories (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, anxiety)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data were cleaned and harmonised in R (dplyr, tidyr, lubridate), including time-series indexing (monthly),
        handling missing values and inconsistencies and creating normalised indicators for cross-regional comparisons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interrupted Time-Series (ITS) Analysis:</strong> estimated the immediate shock (March 2020) and longer-term slope changes after COVID-19 began</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed-Effects Regression (GLMM, lme4):</strong> modelled service use over time while accounting for health board variation</li>
        <li><strong>Model structure:</strong> fixed effects (time, spending, pandemic indicator) + random effects (health board)</li>
        <li><strong>Quality & ethics:</strong> sensitivity checks with lagged models, cross-year validation, aggregate/anonymised data only</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharp decline in inpatient admissions:</strong> early 2020 drops (over ~25% in some regions) with incomplete recovery—suggesting constrained access/capacity rather than reduced need</li>
        <li><strong>Regional and age inequalities:</strong> steepest reductions in urban boards (e.g., Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Lothian, Grampian) and strongest impact on younger adults (18–29)</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnosis patterns:</strong> severe disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar) remained comparatively stable, while depression and anxiety admissions fell sharply—consistent with shifts toward community/remote care</li>
        <li><strong>Spending vs service use:</strong> despite rising mental health budgets, inpatient activity did not rebound—indicating systemic changes in how support is accessed and delivered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Essentially, the findings show both adaptation and widening gaps: digital/community services expanded, but the transition
        created uneven access across regions and groups. The work reinforces that careful analytics can illuminate social realities
        and support equitable resource targeting.

      <h2>Visual Analytics: R Shiny Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        To make the insights accessible, I built an interactive Shiny dashboard that enables exploration of:
        diagnosis trends, demographic patterns, health board comparisons by year, and pre-/post-COVID changes.
        The dashboard bridges advanced modelling with practical public health storytelling.
